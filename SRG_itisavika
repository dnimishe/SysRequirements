What features would you like to see in this attendance system?
How much course credit would students lose. 
How many teachers would log attendance at once?

1. This is something you need to determine early on before starting anything"
2. I think it would depend on the grade level. Later grades will probably have a bigger punishment than younger ones. 
3. Because failure to do so can end up in losing some pretty important information regarding the child's safety. 

Rahul's Response:
1. We could start off by sorting students by their classes and add them to different tables.
2. I feel it depends on the teacher, some may have no penalties, while some may enforce it.
3. I presume every teacher in the school would be logged in, because they would have to record attendance every period.
